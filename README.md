# hello-world
my very first project at GitHub

I am trying to learn how to use GitHub.
This is the first time I use such tool.
So much already advanced since I wrote my last serious codes.
So much to learn and to catch up.
This is going to be a fun :):)

My first question is that what will happen to my modifications if I did not commit (or save) the changes right away
